As I sit to write these newsletters each week, I am often drawn to the thought that if our group should ever decide 
to choose a song, an anthem or a hymn that defines us, we could do a lot worse than choose the Sydney Carter hymn of 
One more step along the road I go. It is a very upbeat tune, just  as we are a relatively young and upbeat group, 
we do things that possibly many other groups before us have done, but in our case many of the things we do are a 
first for us. Last year we opened our scout troop for the first time as some of our then cubs were coming of an 
age to move up for the first time, just one year after we had opened our cub pack the previous year for the same 
reason, last year we had our first camp. Yes in past years we had been to camp,but as guests of other groups or 
district, this time we set up the camp, our leaders ran the programme to a large extent, our leaders led the hike 
as we have done before, but although we were joined by our colleagues from Barwell, it was very much a 6th Hinckley 
camp and we will do it again soon. Another first, or to be more accurate 2 firsts as it was the first time our scouts 
had gone to Green Towers on the climbing wall, followed just a few weeks later by our cubs making their first visit 
to the same climbing wall. We continue our firsts with later on this year a day trip to a wildlife park and other 
firsts as you will read as you progress through this newsletter.

# Fundraising

As was mentioned last week, we had been nominated to be considered as a good cause to receive a donation from the fb group of Hinckley district past and present. I can now tell you we have, for the second year in a row, been successful and some of the leaders will represent the group and collect the cheque on your behalf, at a presentation evening at The Greyhound pub on 27th February. The amount of donation is not yet known but whatever it is will be gratefully received, coming as it does from the votes of 8,000 members of the group who like us are citizens of  Hinckley.

# Birthday 

Not  a first, but it will our  3rd Birthday since we reformed on 4th February, tomorrow (Monday) and I trust you all enjoyed the cream cakes we had last week to celebrate. Maybe we will do it again next year for our 4th.

# BOB A JOB

Another first is our attempt at bringing back the spirit of Bob a job from years past. Last week all youngsters present were given a tube of Smarties, with the aim of firstly the good bit, of eating the chocolate beans and then by their own endeavours in carrying out jobs or chores, such as cleaning their teeth without being told to, doing their homework without being told to, clearing the tables after meals and doing the washing up or loading the dishwasher, although if parents are feeling generous that could count as 2 jobs. Parents,grandparents,aunties and uncles even older siblings who are working,then reward the youngsters with 20p pieces or £1 coins which the youngsters then put in their tube. When the tube is full they return it to their leaders,who in turn pass it to our treasurer who then banks it as part of group funds which of course benefits all our young people.

# DAY TRIP

As was stated in last weeks newsletter on 11th May we have a day trip to Cotswold wildlife park in Oxfordshire,the cost of which will be announced soon, but is hoped to be around £20 or less. If you are interested in going could you put your names down on the sheet that will be on the subs desk next week. This will aid our planning as to which size coach we need etc.

# GIFT AID

Thank you to all those who have filled in and returned their gift aid forms, to those of you still yet to do so, could you please do so as soon as possible.The quicker we can get the list of names,the sooner our treasurer can apply to Her Majesty,s Revenue and Customs and get a few hundred £££,s off the government, that will go in to group funds, at no cost whatsoever to you. Gift aid forms are available on the subs desk.

# PEN PALS

Another first Lisa our cub leader has had a reply to her letter to a cub troop in the USA, in fact from New York, so in the coming weeks contact between the young members of both groups can be made, and who knows such contacts may last a lifetime. Our beavers will not be left out because we already have  contact with a joey pack (Australian name for their beaver equivalent)  in Sydney Australia,and I am sure also in the coming weeks they will emulate the cubs.

# UNI HOC AND BEYOND

The cubs district uni hoc competition will take place at 7pm on Monday 25th February .For the scouts a little later on Sunday 2nd March they have their district scouts shooting competition at the district rifle range at Britannia HQ. Timings for both will be announced when finalised. Before that a reminder that the scouts archery club will meet at Westfield community centre at 7pm on Tuesday 12th February cost is just £2. A very quiet night at St Francis on Thursday 21st March as both the cubs and scouts are at the campsite at Fox Coverts,leaving just the beavers in residence,more details nearer the date.

# POLLING

As you may have noticed from the political leaflets dropping through your door, and maybe local politicians wanting to talk to you for the first time in ages,we have an election coming up. The date is Thursday 2nd May, and as usual St Francis is a polling station,consequently we cannot meet at the centre so we will meet for Hot dogs,dangling doughnuts,campfire and games at our campsite at Fox Coverts, at our usual time of 6pm for beavers and cubs, scouts will be told if they are doing the same hours or their usual,either way for all sections subs will still be payable.

# CAPITATION

I could not finish without mentioning capitation(membership fee).Thank you to the many of you that have paid,and to those yet to do so, time is now running out. On 31st January it was census day, the day on which I had to list all the numbers of members we had in each section and the executive committee. It was also sadly the day I had to delete names off our register, youngsters we have not seen for a few weeks I had to delete to avoid being billed £45 for each of them. As with those remaining on the list, we as a group can not afford to pay such amounts, which is why each of you pay your £45, so I do urge you if you havent paid yet please do so quickly, that bill from national HQ is now on its way to our treasurer.

All the leaders as always look forward to seeing you all on Thursday,but as always take care of yourselves, take care of others, be kind to all, but most of all stay safe.
