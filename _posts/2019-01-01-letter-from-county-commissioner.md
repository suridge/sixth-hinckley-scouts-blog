As 2018 has come to an end, it gives us a chance to reflect on our achievements.

Not just of our large scale events, but those that we offer week in and week out.

It is these activities that spark the imagination of our Beavers, Cubs, Scouts, Explorer Scouts and Scout Network members and sends them on their journey with skills and the confidence they require.

I believe as a County working together we provide some of the best and most varied programmes of opportunities, in safe and supportive surroundings.

Scouting in Leicestershire only happens and is so successful due to our amazing volunteers.

A lot of people think of Leaders when they think of Scouting, but behind them, I know are an army of wonderful families and non uniformed members that offer support in so many ways from fundraising, gift of time and resources, maintenance along with governance to our charities.

2018 was the first time we have County wide worked with "Toys on The Table", another County Charity we have extended the reach to so many underprivileged young people......

Your generosity is supporting this Charity has took all our breaths away.

2018 also saw the REACH! programme give over Â£70,000 to a variety of projects within the County. We hope to see the grants further extend the opportunity and facilities available.

The New Year will see many more opportunities not only for young people to shine but for our adults as well.

Charnwood 2019, a crazy week of activities and challenges for over 3000 people, the start of our County Explorer Activity Training Unit, St Georges Day Awards and all of our usual activities and events.

Don't forget our Adult Training Support Weekend which will uplift our skills and ideas, it will also be a great opportunity to meet other adults in Scouting and most importantly, have some FUN. All details of this event and other training opportunities are on the County Website under the training tab .

So from the County Teams and myself, a heartfelt thank you to you all and see you all in the New Year.
