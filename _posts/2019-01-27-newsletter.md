As the above reference number shows we are already on our 4th newsletter of the year, time is pressing on which leads to our first bullet point.

# Capitation
Thank you to the many of you who have paid your capitation, and for those who have yet to do so time is running out, please pay as soon as you can, in order that we may qualify for the discount. Failure to claim the discount will of course incur an increase in the amount we as a group must pay to national, money that I would much rather spend for the benefit of our members.

# Gift Aid

I do not intend to cover the finer workings of Gift Aid again this week, having covered it fairly extensively last week. I would just ask all parents to take and fill in the large gift aid forms that are available on the subs desk and return them ASAP to enable our Hon. Treasurer to get our claim in to HMRC.

# Green Towers

Last Wednesday our cubs went climbing on the climbing wall at Green Towers club 4 young people. Everyone taking part appeared to enjoy it, irrespective of reaching the top and ringing the bell or not. Their behaviour was excellent and consequently enhanced the good name of 6th Hinckley (St Francis) scout group. So much so that I would not be surprised if such a night was to appear on the programme again in the future.

# Bob a Job

Looking back in to the mists of time, when I was a cub, we in scouting had what was called Bob a job, a period probably remembered, fondly or otherwise, by maybe some parents, but certainly by most grandparents.This was before the time of such things as sponsored walks or bag packs, and was a means for the young members to raise funds for their own pack or troop, there being no beaver colony,s in scouting at this stage. The aim was to do menial jobs, carry mums shopping from the co-op, help grandad dig his allotment, etc in return for which they were paid 1/- (one shilling) or a bob as was its nickname, for each job they did, hence bob a job.
This Thursday each young member will be given a tube of Smarties, the idea being that they take them home, and having eaten the Smarties, they then do jobs for family members and relatives, or keeping their bedroom tidy, cleaning their teeth without being told to, help dad clean the car, (although I would expect substantially more than a bob for such a job) in return for 20p pieces or £1 coins if you are feeling rich, putting them in the tube and returning them on the next  meeting  when full. Such funds will now as then be given to the treasurer and banked in group funds.

# Day Trip

As bob a job is a first for us, so to is this next item since we reformed in 2016. On Saturday 11th May we are having a day trip to the Cotswold Wildlife Park at Burford, Oxfordshire. A coach will take us from Tudor Road at 9am to the Wildlife Park and return to Tudor Road at approx 5pm. More details will be in future newsletters including the cost, as they are finalised. In the meantime make a note in your diaries or calendars.

# Birthday

This is not a first, but for those who have been with us since the beginning, believe it or not, it is our 3rd Birthday, since we reformed on 4th February 2016. As the 4th is mid way through the week it matters little which day we do it so I have chosen this Thursday as the day when we shall have fresh cream cake. Thank you to everyone who has helped, supported or pushed us to where we are today, we could not have done it without you.Please keep up what you are doing, we still have a lot to do.

# Leaders

Having in recent weeks had many of our leaders successfully go through the appointments panel, and 1 still to go to panel, who I am sure will be equally successful, we are talking to 2 other adults who have expressed a wish to be leaders. If anyone else is even, only thinking of becoming a leader, come and have a talk with me or any other leader.

# Future Plans

Looking ahead to far and not so far, The cubs District Uni Hoc competition will be held at Stoke Golding and I will confirm the date by Thursday. The scouts have the District scout shooting competition on the 2nd March, the timings for which will be announced soon. For our beavers and cubs they will be doing archery at the range at the campsite on 18th May, again more details nearer the date. On the 2nd May the centre is in use as a polling station so as usual I shall try and arrange to go to the campsite for that evening for hot dogs etc as we normally do, again more details to come.

# Fundraising

At this point in time we have a nomination in to Hinckley District Past and Present again this year, a fb group who support local good causes, as they did with us last year with a cheque for £150, so our fingers are crossed that we are once again successful. We have also applied to the community champion at ASDA to include us in her good causes fund.The outcome of both will be announced on here when known.

As always all the leaders are looking forward to seeing you all on Thursday, until then take care of yourself, take care of others, be kind to all but most of all stay safe.

With regards,
John,
(King Louie)
