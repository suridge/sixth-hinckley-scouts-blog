Thank you to all those who have paid their capitation (membership fee) for 2019, and a reminder to those who have not yet done so, that time is running out as it must be paid by the end of February at the latest.

As Lisa mentioned on our group fb page during the week, our cubs are going on the climbing wall at Green Towers in 2 weeks time. As GT have only given her the choice of 2 dates of availability, Tuesday or Wednesday 22nd/23rd January, the general consensus seems to favour the 22nd, but Lisa will confirm the date this week. On that week only, the cubs will meet for the 1 night at GT and not at the centre, subs will still be payable,although they will not cover the fee from GT, so the difference will be made up from group funds.

At a leaders meeting that was held last Monday evening, the leaders were told of the delivery of 4 chafing dishes that they had asked for,  that were delivered on Christmas eve. In addition the leaders also expressed a wish to have a cast iron Dutch Oven to even further enhance the cooking capability whilst at camp, this was ordered along with a tripod and a lid lifter, and duly arrived, as can be seen by the picture on our group fb page. These purchases together, plus others to come in coming weeks, not only improve our cooking on camp, but also shows the parents, carers and group supporters where some of their hard earned fundraising money is going, in order that our young people have a far better camping experience than would otherwise have been the case without them. There are only so many baked beans you can have before you get fed up with them.

Those of you who are not yet on our fb page. Why not? It is a totally closed and safe page only open to parents, carers, executive and leaders of 6th Hinckley group. It enables parent to contact parent, to arrange transport to events for example, to sell or exchange uniform that your child has outgrown, it also enables the leadership and the executive to pass information to all parents and carers. In order to be a member of the page go on to facebook and click on 6th Hinckley beavers,cubs and scouts, request membership and 1 of the 2 admins (myself or Andrew) will approve you on to the page,that way no one who is unknown to either Andrew or myself can get access.

As the name suggests, leaders meetings are only open to leaders, who run the scouting and activities side of the group, another meeting taking place this week, one of many throughout the course of a year that parents dont always get to  know about, but are essential to the running of this great group of ours, is our executive committee meeting. The purpose of the executive committee is to run the business side of the group as outlined in last weeks newsletter. The deliberations of the executive are not always passed on to the parents and carers, unless it directly effects them, not for any secretive or underhand reason but as it is the often mundane paperwork side of life there is very little if anything to get excited about. If however you do in fact wish to be involved in such discussions as a member of the committee,you do not need to wait to be voted on, you may nominate yourself on to the committee, simply contact Andrew our group Chairman and you are in.

More detailed information will be given nearer the date, but if our Scouts could book in to their diaries,  the weekend of 14th/15th and 16th June,which is fathers day weekend, you will be doing litter picking at Ashby Magna steam fair to obtain a donation from the organisers that will go towards your bill for Charnwood 19, you will be camping on the side of the car parking field with our colleagues from 11th Hinckley who will be marshalling the car parking for the same reason you are litter picking.

Again for our scouts, the district shooting competition will be held on 2nd March, a date for all our sharpshooters to possibly excel. You will be shooting .177 air rifles at our district rifle range at Britannia scout HQ.

For our beavers who have not been forgotten, a date is to be arranged for some time in May for you to do archery at our district archery range at Fox Coverts campsite. This is being arranged because our district indoor archery range has insufficient room on the firing point to accomodate beavers,  who are normally in larger numbers than both cubs and scouts, which meant archery could not be organised for you during the winter. It is for your safety as the arrows we use do not have rubber suckers but sharp metal points on them.

This coming Thursday the beavers are doing water filtration, turning dirty water in to clean water, and just for a change parents are invited to stay and help, but be warned it may get a little dirty (It will wash off its only muck)

As can be seen from the contents of this newsletter all 3 sections have a very varied programme ahead of them, and we havent even reached the weather to go outside yet , so we have camps. hikes, possibly bike rides and lots more to look forward to.

Still looking forward to meeting our new starters, Lexon, Amy and James who will hopefully be joining us on Thursday this week.

As always all the leaders are looking forward to seeing you all again next week, but as ever look after yourselves, look after each other, be kind to others but always stay safe.

With regards,
John
