The 2024 Christmas lights switch-on and Tin Hat Fair in Hinckley, will take place 
on Friday, November 22 2024. We have a fund raising stall where we will be running 
the ever popular 'Teddy Tombola', and we need your help! 
<!--end-summary-->

On **Thursday 21st November 2024** we will be wrapping the Teddy's that we have 
collected and washed over the last few weeks, getting them ready for the following night. 
We are looking for volunteers to help. The management room at the center will be 
available from 1800 and all materials supplied.

On **Friday 22nd November 2024** we will be running the stall on Castle Street (have we got 
anymore specific details of where the stall is?), from 1600 - 2000 (any more specifics) and 
we are looking for volunteers to help run the stall?  

Anything else to add?
